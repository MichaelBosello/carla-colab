## Running CARLA simulator on Google Colab

[Carla](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research.

Since it is hardware demanding, it could be useful for students to run it on colab.

The notebook in this repository shows how to run and visualize CARLA on colab.
